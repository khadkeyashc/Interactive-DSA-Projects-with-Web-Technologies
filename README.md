# Real-World Data Structures & Algorithms using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project is a curated collection of interactive programs that demonstrate the application of core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript, styled with CSS, and structured through HTML. Each program visualizes a real-life use case—ranging from graph-based route planning to stack-based undo-redo systems—making DSA concepts not only functional but also visually engaging and easy to understand.
Whether it's simulating queue systems in banks, managing browser tabs with stacks, or implementing sorting algorithms in e-commerce, this collection showcases how frontend technologies can bring algorithmic logic to life.

1) Graph Algorithms
These programs involve the use of graphs, including nodes and edges, to solve problems related to connectivity, pathfinding, route planning, and network structures. Example use cases include detecting cycles in a graph, implementing social network friend recommendations, train route optimization, and collaborative document editing.

2) Stack and Queue Operations
Several programs use stacks and queues to simulate real-time systems where order of processing is important. Scenarios like ATM queues, browser tab management, undo-redo functionality in code editors, and job scheduling systems are implemented using these data structures.

3) Tree-Based Algorithms
A number of applications make use of trees such as AVL trees, red-black trees, and heaps. These are used to manage data efficiently in systems like dynamic leaderboards, event ranking platforms, and minimum spanning tree-based power grids.

4) Sorting Algorithms
Programs under this category demonstrate the use of classic sorting techniques (e.g., merge sort, heap sort) to organize and rank data. Examples include contact list sorting, patient data organization, inventory sorting, and traffic data analysis.

5) Searching Algorithms
These applications utilize efficient searching strategies like binary search and hashing to find information quickly. For instance, binary search is used in e-commerce product searches, while hash tables are applied in dictionary implementations and storage systems.

6)General DSA Applications
Beyond specific data structures, many programs incorporate multiple DSA techniques to simulate complex systems and solve optimization problems. Examples include the knapsack problem, memory block allocation, and movie ticket booking systems.
